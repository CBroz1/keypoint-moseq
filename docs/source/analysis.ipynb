    "**Welcome to Keypoint MoSeq Analysis Visualization Notebook!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a collection of analyses we typically perform on behavioral recordings to better understand mouse behavior. Examples of such analyses are:\n",
    "- adding experimental group labels to the session\n",
    "- descriptive labeling of individual syllables\n",
    "- comparing syllable usage across different experimental groups\n",
    "- comparing syllable transition structure across different experimental groups\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to provide you with a basic summary of syllable usage and sequencing statistics across experimental conditions and to help generate more specific questions related to observations you may identify here.\n",
    "If you want to perform more specific analyses, you can export the MoSeq data (see below) to use with the tool (i.e., Excel, Python, R, Matlab) you're most comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the **Markdown** above each cell describes the purpose of the cell(s), cell output, and the instructions for running the cell(s) and/or interacting with the widget. The **inline code comments** in the code block provides contextual information about the function, code structure, and parameters.\n",
